# Python To-Do List Application

## Description
This project is a command-line based To-Do List application developed using Python. It allows users to manage daily tasks by adding new tasks, viewing existing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. All tasks are stored locally in a text file, ensuring data persistence between program runs. The project demonstrates core Python programming concepts and is suitable for beginners.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Persistent storage using a text file
- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- File handling
- Lists and dictionaries
- Functions
- Loops and conditional statements

## Project Structure
python-to-do-list/
│
├── to_do_list.py
└── tasks.txt

## How It Works
Each task is stored as a dictionary with two fields:
- task: Description of the task
- status: Pending or Completed

Tasks are saved in a text file in the following format:
Task Name|Status
